Expermients with mininet and open flow switches

## Set-up
Copy all files to the homedir in the mininet AMI and run

    cd ~
    sh build.sh

## Start by script
From the home directory run

    sudo sh startbintree.sh

for the binary tree and

    sudo sh startfattree.sh

for the fat tree. The scripts will drop a mininet shell where you can do the testing.
